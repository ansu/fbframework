	  "description":"Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani has the bright fresh scent of citrus smoothly blended with a rosemary spiciness and jasmine with a wood base. The woody scent for men evokes the freedom of the outdoors with the slightly bitter citrus tone providing the illusion of fresh breezes in tropical climes. Introduced in 1997, Acqua Di Gio is perfect for casual use where there's still a need to leave behind the impact of a classy Armani inspired presence throughout the day.",

      "description":"Davidoff is a Swiss luxury goods brand name, which is carried by a range of products including cigars, cigarettes, and pipe tobaccos. It entered the world of fragrances with the creation of Cool Water. Deceptively simple in composition, Cool Water is one of those masculine colognes that merges with a man’s skin and reads more like his personal aura than a cologne. This is its charm and the artistry behind legendary perfumer Pierre Bourdon’s sleight of hand. And yet, this particular fragrance has launched a thousand upstarts, which try but never succeed in surpassing its lethally attractive whisper. From crab apple and lavender to citrus, all the way through subtle driftwood and hushed amber and musk, Cool Water is a modern classic that is dependable for any season and any occasion. You can’t but like the guy who wears it!",

	  "description":"The brand Diesel was born more than 20 years ago and is today an innovative international design company, manufacturing jeans and casual clothing as well as accessories. Renzo Rosso was the founder of the company which started in 1978, he wanted it to be a leader, a company which took chances and carved out a niche for itself in its field. He was surrounded by creative and talented people around him as well as the innovators who, like him, rejected the slavish trend-following typical of the fashion industry. Diesel “historical moments include mile-stones like 1978 (creation of the brand name), 1985, 1991 (beginning of the international marketing strategy) and 1996. The company views the world as a single, border-less macro-culture. And the Diesel staff reflects this: a wide variety of people and personalities from all parts of the globe. Today Diesel is a global concern with a consolidated annual turnover of 575 billion Lire (US$ 330 million), 85% of which is generated outside Italy. Launched by the design house of Diesel in 1995, DIESEL ZERO PLUS is classified as a refined, oriental, woody fragrance. This masculine scent possesses a blend of woods.
